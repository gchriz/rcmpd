rcmpd - Controlling MPD (Music Player Daemon) with an IR Remote Control
=======================================================================

*rcmpd* is written as a bash script with very little requirements.

It should work on all Linuxes with MPD_ and LIRC_ (tested on a `Raspberry Pi`_ originally with Volumio_ and now with stock Raspberry Pi OS).

Some documentation is included in the script itself. Much more in the enclosed files:

* features.rst
* example_ir_remotes.rst
* usage.rst
* install.rst
* how_it_works.rst

Those .rst files are formatted in `reStructuredText`_, if anyone is wondering.
They are used to automatically generate the html files for my site as well.

So the complete infos are available on my *rcmpd* site: http://ziemski.net/rcmpd/.
